# NPCs Living in a Virtual Village Powered by ChatGPT

This project aims to develop a virtual village simulation using AI and LLM-driven NPC generation. The goal is to create a realistic and dynamic environment where non-player characters (NPCs) interact with each other.

## Features

- AI-driven NPC behavior: NPCs will have their own unique personalities, preferences, and goals, which will influence their actions and interactions within the virtual village.
- LLM-driven NPC generation: ChatGPT and other LLMs will be used to generate diverse and realistic NPC dialogues and conversations.
- Dynamic environment: The virtual village will evolve and change over time based on the actions and decisions of the NPCs.
- Interactive gameplay: NPCs will have the ability to interact with each other, make choices, and influence the decision of others.
